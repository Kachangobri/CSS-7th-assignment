        I will dearly miss you mis Steve Jobs he inspired me to keep getting the iphones i <br>
        have loved them over since the first one. Steve Jobs was a great man and awesome <br>
        CEO for APPLE. he has inspired me to Work with the APPLE when i get old but my dream <br>
        was to own APPLE and follow by Steve jobs ways and make APPLE greater than before

    <h3>So sad</h3>
    <p>As i heard this sad news via my iphone i am emailing my condolences from <br>
        my macbook pro, Steve have left a fingerprint on our culture that can not <br>

    <h3>Steve Jobs</h3>
    <p>What impact has Steve Jobs had on my life? Every short story I've written as <br>
        an adult (and certainly every one that has been published), almost every email <br>
         I've ever written, has been written on machines created by Apple. I interacted <br>
         online using an Apple machine long before I ever encountered a PC. Steve Jobs <br>
         helped to realize the Star Trek future I dreamed of as a kid. And through his <br> 
         vision, I have been able to realize my own. You'll be missed, Mr. Jobs. <br><br>
         Thanks for all your amazing work.

    <h3>His gone</h3>
    <p>A part of my heart has cracked. I didn't know him personally but I felt like I knew him. <br> 
        I will forever remember him. I'm still saddened because he was taken too soon. I can <br>
        only imagine his struggles. Heaven has certainly gained an angel. <br><br>

    <h3>condolence</h3>
    <p>Dear Apple I was deeply saddened to hear about the death of Steve Jobs, the great leader <br>
        and creator in the world. I believe he would go to a more beautiful place and he would <br>
        like to see a stronger Apple. We will remember him forever. <br><br>

    <h3>I will always remember Steve</h3>
    <p>Dear Steve's family, dear Apple company I can't find words how to describe my feelings... <br>
     For me Apple means a lot - I got a good job using Apple products, I have found a new <br>
     lifestyle thanks to Apple. And, of course, I've been always admiring your products. <br>
     And for me everything in Apple is connected with Steve. I do hope he'll be remembered <br>
     around the world as a

       <small> Genius.</small>
        </p>
    <br><br>

    <h3>Thanks</h3>

    <h3>Deepest condolence</h3>
    <p>Dear Apple Family, We are all deeply saddened by Steve's passing. He will be very <br>
         sorely missed. But we know that his flame burn on, at the core of Apple. <br><br>

    <h3>To those close to Steve</h3>
    <p>My thoughts and prayer are with you all tonight. The company Steve started has <br>
     touched the lives of many in this world and he will be missed. I know he will live <br>
     on in spirit, through the lives of all who knew him well. As a sign of respect for  <br>
     Steve, I will be turning my IPhone, IPod, and IPad off for one hour. <br>
     May Steve rest in peace. <br><br>
